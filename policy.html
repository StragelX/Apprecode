                    LEGAL BASIS OF PROCESSING
                </h2>

                <p>
                    If your personal information is protected by EU data protection law, EPAM’s legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which EPAM collects it.
                    <br><br> 
                    However, EPAM will normally collect personal information from you only (a) where it needs the personal information to perform a contract with you, (b) where the processing is in its legitimate interests and is not overridden by your rights, or (c) where it has your consent to do so. In some cases, EPAM may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
                    <br><br>
                    If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which EPAM collects and uses your personal information, please contact EPAM using the contact details provided under the “Contact Details” heading below and in the right-hand side column.
